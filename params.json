{"name":"Spring-integration-base","tagline":"Example Basic Setup for spring-integration","body":"spring-integration-base\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nWhen I started looking at spring-integration, I had troubles getting a simple\r\nsetup. So here's my result, feel free to use it, and if you have a idea, please\r\nprovide updates.\r\n\r\nThis setup does use gradle, but it's easy to adapt to maven.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe following files are in the project:\r\n\r\n    README.md                                    this Readme\r\n    build.gradle                                 gradle-configuration\r\n    src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/servlet-config.xml   spring-integration configuration\r\n    src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml              web-container configuration\r\n\r\nTo start using spring-integration, take a first look at `build.gradle` and\r\nchoose, witch further artifacts of spring-integration you want to enable, by\r\ndefault, I just enabled core, so you probably want to also enable http, jmx or\r\nmail.\r\n\r\nNow take a look at `servlet-config.xml`, here I enabled most namespaces (you\r\ncan get rid of the ones you don't want to use). Now this is the file you want\r\nto start to define all spring-beans including the spring-integration beans.\r\n\r\nIt's easiest, if you install a plugin to your IDE, like STS for eclipse, see\r\nhttp://spring.io/tools/sts.\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRun `gradle build` to build and test the whole project:\r\n\r\n    rjung:~/spring-integration-base$ gradle build\r\n    :compileJava UP-TO-DATE\r\n    :processResources\r\n    :classes\r\n    :war\r\n    :assemble\r\n    :compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE\r\n    :processTestResources\r\n    :testClasses\r\n    :test\r\n    :check\r\n    :build\r\n    \r\n    BUILD SUCCESSFUL\r\n    \r\n    Total time: 6.211 secs\r\n    rjung:~/spring-integration-base$\r\n\r\nUsing `gradle jettyRun` you can directly run the code locally with jetty, stop\r\nit with Ctrl-C:\r\n\r\n    rjung:~/Projects/spring-integration-base[master*]$ gradle jettyRun\r\n    :compileJava UP-TO-DATE\r\n    :processResources UP-TO-DATE\r\n    :classes UP-TO-DATE\r\n    > Building > :jettyRun > Running at http://localhost:8080/spring-integration-base\r\n\r\nSee further tasks by running `gradle tasks`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
